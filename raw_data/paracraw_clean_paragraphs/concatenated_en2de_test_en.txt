The following program counts how often a certain character c follows a prefix string p of length 4 in Cesar's “ De Bello Gallico ”.
It uses an h_array H for counting. The key type is string, the value is itself an h_array that just counts the frequency for every character c.

It is important to realize that the soma of an individual is in a dynamic interaction with the external environment.
There is an intimate exchange of intake and output of inanimate and animate substances.
For example, the quality of the life process in the form of food consumed by an individual will have a great influence on its somatic ecology as it becomes an integral part of the person.

Microbial protein is the most efficient source of protein for cows as its amino acid profile is very similar to that of milk.
Rumen microbes require a steady supply of non-protein nitrogen (NPN), as well as amino acids and an energy source, to produce microbial protein, which is then directly available to the cow.
However, excess NPN can result in raised blood urea levels and reduced fertility and production, so it is important to ensure an optimal, but consistent supply throughout the day.
Subsequently, feed ingredients that optimize amino acid and microbial protein supply should be included in the ration.
Optimizing rumen function can help maximise cow health, fertility and performance.

Project-based, performative, on the move—is a possible description of the European Kunsthalle’s program.

Austria celebrated with Christian Clerici.
The TV presenter triumphed at Stefan Raab’s celebrity ski event "Der große TV total Parallelslalom" in Tyrol’s St. Anton in front of 5,000 ecstatic spectators.
In a truly nail-biting final, Christian Clerici was faster than the Kempten-based TV judge Alexander Hold.
In the semi-final, Clerici had previously beaten host and initiator, Stefan Raab.
Following his defeat in the play-off final for third and fourth places, the entertainer lost out to DJ Bobo and ended the event in an unsatisfactory fourth position.
But Stefan Raab was nonetheless thrilled: "To take fourth place among these remarkable athletes is huge for somebody like me who comes from a region without hills or mountains."

ZDF Enterprises was founded in 1993 as a commercial subsidiary of ZDF, one of the largest and most renowned TV broadcasters in Europe.
Headquartered in Mainz, Germany, ZDF Enterprises is responsible for the worldwide sale of programs, the making of international coproductions, the acquisition of licenses as well as the merchandising of strong program brands in its own name, for the ZDF, and for third parties.
ZDF Enterprises has successfully established itself as an independent market player on the German and international stage.
Bound into a strong group, the company manages the largest German-language stock of programs in the world and, next to this, a continuously growing portfolio of international productions consisting of series and miniseries, TV movies, documentaries and children’s programs.
In the course of the development and diversification process carried out up to now, many business fields in the television and media domains were made accessible in the ZDF Enterprises group.
Thus ZDF Enterprises can provide a comprehensive, full-service offering today, and covers every step in the chain of origin and exploitation of successful TV programs, from development to production and up to the marketing of TV licenses, merchandising rights, online rights and much more.

In a context where European macroeconomic policies resist pressures to stimulate new demand and redistribute income, a generalised return to growth is unlikely.
Without a substantial increase of public demand an end of the current depression is unlikely.
Moreover, the aftermath of the crisis is likely to be marked by a more polarised industrial structure, where weak countries, regions, industries and firms become weaker, and where also the ‘centre’ may be left with lower demand, and a reduced ability to develop new technologies and economic activities.
With a slowdown of overall growth in Europe and economic decline affecting several areas of its ‘periphery’, change is likely to become more difficult.
Europe as a whole would be stuck in its traditional economic trajectory – with sluggish markets, a heavy environmental burden, and growing inequality – while other advanced and emerging countries may move faster towards new knowledge, new products and processes andnew sources of employment, supported by faster demand dynamics.

The more dirty the voltage is the more imperfect is the sound performance.
Furthermore, most USB and DAC chips generate the digital clock from that 5 V voltage.

Revolutionary Social-Democracy has always included the struggle for reforms as part of its activities.
But it utilises “economic” agitation for the purpose of presenting to the government, not only demands for all sorts of measures, but also (and primarily) the demand that it cease to be an autocratic government.
Moreover, it considers it its duty to present this demand to the government on the basis, not of the economic struggle alone, but of all manifestations in general of public and political life.
In a word, it subordinates the struggle for reforms, as the part to the whole, to the revolutionary struggle for freedom and for socialism.
Martynov, however, resuscitates the theory of stages in a new form and strives to prescribe, as it were, an exclusively economic path of development for the political struggle.
By advancing at this moment, when the revolutionary movement is on the upgrade, an alleged special “task” of struggling for reforms, he is dragging the Party backwards and is playing into the hands of both “Economist” and liberal opportunism.

Biblical revelation makes it clear, that man is called upon to do everything on his part in order to accept what God, in His love, has prepared for him.
For this reason, man is called to conversion, as a way to peace, on which he leaves everything behind that is hindering him from experiencing and living peace.
In order to succeed in this conversion, which means to abandon this world and its promises and to open oneself to God, who is peace, an individual, a family and, from time to time, also the entire people did not only have to pray but also to fast, to believe and love, to reconcile and forgive, to finally overcome all difficulties and to find the peace which God promises.

My grandfather was a lawyer and he was ready to be a judge.

The story of the game is quickly explained: You have to defend your cities against waves of incoming (nuclear) missiles.
For this task you have three SAM sites, Surface to Air Missile, one to the left, one in the middle and one to the right of the screen.
Six cities are located between the missile launchers.
Each level of the game is represented by a wave of incoming missiles, coming from the top of the screen.
Some of them are MIRVs (Multiple Independently targetable Reentry Vehicles), in other words, on their way down, they split and suddenly you have to shoot down two instead one target.
So far so good, your first problem is that you fight missiles with missiles, that is, every time you fire it takes some time till your missile reaches its destination and detonates there.
Thus, you have to calculate a little bit in order to hit a target.
To make it a bit easier, your missiles burst into a fireball. So you don't have to hit an incoming missile directly to destroy it.
If it flies into the explosion, it is destroyed and produces a fireball itself that might destroy another target in advance.

Bernardo Bertolucci does the nearly impossible with this sweeping, grand epic that tells a very personal tale. The story is a dramatic history of Pu Yi, the last of the emperors of China.
It follows his life from its elite beginnings in the Forbidden City, where he was crowned at age three and worshipped by half a billion people.
He was later forced to abdicate and, unable to fend for himself in the outside world, became a dissolute and exploited shell of a man.
He died in obscurity, living as a peasant in the People's Republic.
Filmed in the Forbidden City, it is spectacularly beautiful, filling the screen with saturated colors and exquisite detail.

1 And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 2 And Balak did as Balaam had said; and Balak and Balaam offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.
3 And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever he shews me I will tell thee.
And he went to a hill.
4 And God met Balaam; and [Balaam] said to him, I have disposed seven altars, and have offered up a bullock and a ram upon [each] altar.
5 And Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak. 6 And he returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.
7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, curse me Jacob, and come, denounce Israel! 8 How shall I curse whom ùGod hath not cursed? or how shall I denounce whom Jehovah doth not denounce? 9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: Lo, [it is] a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations.
10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel?
Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my end be like his! 11 And Balak said to Balaam, What hast thou done to me?
12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah puts in my mouth? 13 And Balak said to him, Come, I pray thee, with me to another place, from whence thou wilt see them; thou shalt see only the extremity of them and shalt not see them all, and curse me them from thence.
14 And he took him to the watchmen's field, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on [each] altar.
15 And [Balaam] said to Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, and I will go to meet yonder.
16 And Jehovah met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.
17 And he came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him; and Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken? 18 Then he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear! hearken unto me, son of Zippor! 19 ùGod is not a man, that he should lie; neither a son of man, that he should repent.
Shall he say and not do? and shall he speak and not make it good? 20 Behold, I have received [mission] to bless; and he hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it.
21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen wrong in Israel; Jehovah his God is with him, and the shout of a king is in his midst.
22 ùGod brought him out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo.
23 For there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel.
At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath ùGod wrought! 24 Lo, the people will rise up as a lioness, and lift himself up as a lion.
He shall not lie down until he have eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain. 25 And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.
26 And Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell thee, saying, All that Jehovah shall speak, that will I do? 27 And Balak said to Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee to another place; perhaps it will be right in the sight of God that thou curse me them from thence.
28 And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks over the surface of the waste.
29 And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on each altar.

Living conditions in Vienna at Beethoven's time were far different from today and thus cannot be compared directly.
To get an objective picture, Beethoven needs to be seen within his time.
The then cost of living mainly comprised expenses for food, rent and clothing.
In his "New Sketch of Vienna" from 1804 contemporary Johann Pezzl concluded that the minimal expenses for a man living by himself, without any splendour or posh public office and only socialising with the middle classes amounted up to 967 florins.
However, if one includes theatre visits now and then and other public or private amusement, less than 1,200 florins a year are not sufficient.
To be able to compare this information with today, such "amusement expenses" will have to be included.
But even then 41 % were still spent on food (without taking any spare time activities into account this was 52 %) while modern society spends only a fifth on food.
Clothing, with 19 %, was significantly more expensive than today (6 %), too.
Unlike then we now spend more money on rent and additional costs (37 % today versus 14 % back then).
If calculating the budget for 1809 and taking into consideration the price development for food and rent, a total of 1,600 florins results.
The financial support Beethoven initially obtained from his patrons was thus more than twice the budget a middle class man disposed of.
In the most extreme years of 1816 and 1817, the composer's salary of 3,400 florins was even below Pezzl's budget of about 3,750 florins.

In Helsingfors and Sveaborg, Admiral Nepenin did not admit the news of the insurrection in Petrograd until the night of March 4, threatening the soldiers and sailors meanwhile with acts of repression. So much the more ferocious was the insurrection of these soldiers and sailors.

Many officers were arrested.
The most hateful were shoved under the ice. “Judging by Skobelev’s account of the conduct of the officers of the fleet and the Helsingfors authorities,” writes Sukhanov, who is by no means indulgent to the “dark rank-and file,” “it is a wonder these excesses were so few.”

typeN? a Scheme type predicate for which argN must return #t.
There is also a special form (predicate? default) for specifying optional arguments.
If the actual argument is missing when the function is being called, the default value is substituted instead.
Default values are evaluated at definition time (including LilyPond code blocks!), so if you need a default calculated at runtime, instead write a special value you can easily recognize.
If you write the predicate in parentheses but don’t follow it with a default value, #f is used as the default.
Default values are not verified with predicate? at either definition or run time: it is your responsibility to deal with the values you specify.
Default values that happen to be music expressions are copied while setting origin to the location parameter.

Nikos Mamidakis, with origins from Chania, Crete, after finishing his studies in Italy, travelled in several places around the world.
All the experience he obtained as a child, childhood memories as well as the studying of local products, made him take the decision to offer to the world flavours and homemade recipes that were transferred for many generations till today.
In that way, Arodama Company was founded.
The name was taken after a legend describing that when the Titans were born, Goddess of Life in an attempt to protect her daughter, Earth, she gave her the tree of Life.
That tree gave life to Earth and when a Goddess was born, one twig â Arodamosâ was planted onto that tree.
Gods used to taste the â ambrosiaâ of that tree and become immortal. God Ifaistos asked from Goddess Athena to create founts in the area where the tree was, so Hercules could rest after his Labours.
Arodama Company started exporting food products and beverages in spring 2014.

The essential oil (less than 1%) is of complex and variable com position.
Within the species, several dif ferent chemical races exist, and further more climate, soil and time of harvest influence not only the amount but also the composition of the essential oil.
The most important aroma components are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although not necessarily in this order; typically, one or two of those dominate the oil, but hardly any basil contains all of these com pounds in significant amounts.
African species often contain camphor. Some species are characterized by compounds outside of the mentioned spectrum, e. g. thymol.

In 1754, Wesley wrote these words concerning the Papacy: "He is in an emphatical sense, the Man of Sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure.
And he is, too, properly styled the Son of Perdition, as he has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers...
He it is... that exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped... claiming the highest power, and highest honour... claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone." (quoted in the 'Antichrist and His Ten Kingdoms', p.110).

In the evening, after all visitors have left, the valuable train is placed “lonely” on the holding track.
In order to ensure that it won’t be damaged during the night, SECURITAS employees are deployed at each tour station and watch over the “Train of Ideas” – to protect it from vandalism and graffiti. “We are the only private security service provider, which – throughout the journey of the „Train of Ideas“ – was able to offer qualified security “from one source,” Wolfgang Peper, Segment Manager ÖPV at SECURITAS says happily.
“During the tendering procedure, we stayed in close contact with our colleagues on site, which enabled us to pay special attention to any local particularities and offer individual solutions. These colleagues are aware of the situation and problems, they know where the risk of graffiti is high and where nocturnal visitors are to be expected,” Project Manager Christian Blümel adds.
On the whole, 50 SECURITAS security officers from 18 European metropolises work 1650 hours – on 110 work days – to provide security for the innovative train.

This character of the state had always been recognized by Marx and Engels, who examined its relation to historical development and to proletarian revolution in all its aspects.
They laid the theoretical foundations for a theory of the state in unmistakable terms within the framework of historical materialism.
Logically enough it is precisely on this issue that opportunism deviates furthest from them.
On all other issues it was possible to present (like Bernstein) the ‘revision’ of particular economic theories as if their basis were still – after all – consistent with the essence of Marx’s method, or (like Kautsky) to give the ‘orthodox’ consolidated economic theory a mechanistic and fatalistic slant.
But the mere raising of those problems regarded by Marx and Engels as fundamental to their theory of the state involves in itself the recognition of the actuality of the proletarian revolution.
The opportunism of all the leading currents in the Second International is illustrated most clearly by the fact that none of them dealt seriously with the problem of the state. On this decisive issue there is no difference between Kautsky and Bernstein.
All, without exception, simply accepted the bourgeois state.
If they did criticize it, they only did so to oppose merely isolated aspects and manifestations of it harmful to the proletariat.
The state was regarded exclusively from the perspective of specific day-to-day issues; its character was never examined and evaluated from that of the proletariat as a whole.
The revolutionary immaturity and confusion of the left wing of the Second International is also shown in its equal incapacity to clarify the problem of the state.
It went, at times, as far as dealing with the problem of revolution, of fighting against the state, but it was unable concretely to formulate the problem of the state itself even at a purely theoretical level, let alone point out its concrete practical consequences in historical reality.

In addition to the growing administrative and regulatory requirements that will become more exacting on account of the global financial and sovereign debt crises, financial institutions are struggling against the increasing evaporation of confidence and growing reputational risks.
Moreover, many of them are at risk of becoming less innovative, while the adaptation rate of new web-based technologies continues to rise across a variety of industries.
Established banks are being forced to adjust their business strategies to embrace digitally driven structural change.
It cannot be ruled out that net players such as Google, Apple, Amazon, PayPal or Facebook will expand their existing service offering in order to enter, for example, the market for standardised financial services.
The net players are doing exceptionally well in integrating changing patterns of consumption and media use – especially of internet-savvy consumers – into their offerings.
Above all, some of them have sufficient liquidity at their disposal to experiment in the market for web-based technologies.
If one project fails, it takes no time to pick another one from the pipeline and arrange its funding.
So this raises the question for traditional banks as to whether they (will) play a relatively active role or more of a passive one.

No, Thomas Müller is not a particularly good dancer.
“Best not go down that road,” the 61-year-old says, avoiding the subject.
He doesn’t have to be.
He has other fish to fry.
For 32 years now the fourth-generation head of the family-run company Diamant Tanzschuhe in Bad Soden has ensured that people in 37 countries can skillfully flit across the dance floor wearing shoes that weigh just a couple of hundred grams.
Müller has been involved in the manufacture of shoes for over 40 years, having learned the trade at the ARS Suttoria School in Milan.
The history of the Müller family began with the founding of a “business for the production of natural shoes” by the master shoemaker Eberhard Müller in 1873 in Frankfurt’s Ziegelgasse.
The only manufacturer of dancing shoes in Germany moved to Bad Soden in 1958 when Angulus Otto Müller KG was founded. 17 years later, under the name “Diamant”, a collection of dance shoes was launched that renowned German dancers, male and female, had helped design.
Having specialized in dance shoes, the company changed its name to Diamant Schuhfabrik Otto Müller KG in 1982.
Thanks to improved process automation and the use of cutting-edge technology, there is now a choice of over 80 different models.
A wide range of materials, heels and widths enables in excess of 1,000 versions.
“Made in Bad Soden” has long since become a special quality seal.
Several million shoes have already been dispatched throughout the world from this little spa town.
“They don’t have to be expensive,” the boss says. Despite high-tech advancements, a Diamant dance shoe still involves a lot of craftsmanship of up to 40 stages – performed by employees who in some cases are themselves part of the family.
With regard to the future, Thomas Müller doesn’t need to worry.
His wife Petra Müller-Unger is just as much by his side as their children Bianca and Oliver.

As the level of direct foreign investments has drastically dropped in the past two years, the government is preparing a by-law to define investment incentives.
The goal is to turn Serbia into a more attractive destination for investors than countries in the region are in order that major world companies should redirect their capital to Serbia.
Almost all the states created through the disintegration of former Yugoslavia have their own agencies specialized in establishing contacts with potential investors and proposing concrete measures to improve the busines setting. As for financial incentives for opening new work positions, the states granting them have regulated that segment through special laws, which define the criteria for the allotment of funds and project realization control.
In the past period, financial incentives in Serbia were granted from the budget, but it was SIEPA agency that was in charge of their distribution.
That did not yield very good results, primarily because the spending of the funds was not subject to control so sometimes the number of employees was lower than the envisaged one or projects were just partly realized. Therefore a new mechanism for attracting foreign investments was announced, of the implementation of which the minister of economy will be in charge.

Nonetheless, the divisions were also obvious.
The first series of steps that form the boundary between the main square and the street in front of the parliament turned out to be the natural border between two different political approaches as well as lifestyles: Queen Amalia Street became the gathering point of supporters of the right, the extreme right and patriots in general.
At the main square gathered leftists of various shadings, liberals and anarchists.
Smaller divisions occurred, as is often the case, among the left.
The Communist Party (KKE) was aloof, regarding the movement as ineffective.
By contrast, SYRIZA, the second of the main left parties, along with smaller parties of the extra-parliamentary left, actively supported, without patronizing, the demonstrations.

Both time and space have long been favorite subjects.
She multiplies shots of her children in spaces that are at once closed and transparent, like windows.
"The image of children in windows interests me.
At first, it was our tradition.
Beginning when my triplets were two years old, I put them in the window so that they would play for a moment in complete security in a space that is at the border of inside and outside."
For the artist, these images of the space between inside and outside were the occasion to address problems of imprisonment and freedom.
Her recent works Memories and Memories Illusion are photographs of her children taken in the window of an old fort in the Tunisian village, Ghar el Melh, that was once a prison for slaves in North Africa.
Here, the artist explores how this fort parallels Senegal's Slaves House on Gorée Island, which she had an opportunity to visit several years ago.
It is this same idea that led to the installation, Fate, for which Mouna Jemal received second prize at the 9th Dakar Biennale.
She symmetrically multiplies fragmented photographs of her children taken inside the fort's windows.
These images of bodies crowded together and arranged alternately right side up and upside down create a virtual boat that brings to mind the risks of servitude and of past and present migrations.

GEA Farm Technologies has specially developed the EuroClass system for medium sized herds. The crucial difference between this and a conventional herringbone milking parlor is the new front exit.
With the same size herd, the fact that the animals exit more quickly reduces the changeover time by about 50% compared with the conventional EuroClass 1200.
With shorter waiting times for the animals, throughput rates are 15% higher.

For companies and private people, this ultimately means taking responsibility for the environment and for coming generations.
Everyone, in all areas, is expected to act conscientiously and sustainably, regardless of whether it is about co-determination in a democratic society, private provision of the individual, or social responsibility of companies.
Assuming responsibility means thinking holistically.
Some of these aspects are now defined and regulated precisely, while others are still in a process of development.
Responsible construction, for example, is often equated with sustainable construction. Certification systems are used to document this aspect of responsibility.

The unification of Germany under Prussian supremacy was the avowed aim of Otto von Bismarck, whom King Wilhelm I. had appointed Prime Minister of Prussia in 1862.
Following the 1866 war against Austria, the German Confederation was dis¬ solved and replaced by the North German Confederation , which comprised 17 small German states under Prussian leadership. The victory over France in 1870/1 led to the foundation of the Second German Reich and the proclamation in Versailles of Wilhelm I as German Emperor.
Bismarck remained Prime Minister and also became Reich Chancellor.
The Reichstag was restructured as the people’s elected representation, albeit with restricted rights.
Bismarck led a bitter fight against leftwing liberalism, political Catholicism and social democracy, but in the 1880s was also responsible for the most progressive welfare legislation in the whole of Europe.
Conflicts with Emperor Wilhelm II, who had been in power since 1888, led in 1890 to the dismissal of the “Iron Chancellor”.

The globalization of markets has led to customer and deadline constraints in the automotive industry. In consequence car manufacturers have been forced to expand their portfolios and shorten their product development times.
An increasing number of car development projects have had to be implemented and the development times cut at the same time. This has led to the installation of Simultaneous Engineering principles and Multi-Project Management methods.
Today Project Management Software Systems (PMSS) are required to support the Scheduling processes.
However, from the car manufacturers’ viewpoint the PMSS show functional deficits in cross-project and cross-company scheduling.
The lecture demonstrates existing requirements on the basis of practical examples – such as the generic (precedence) relationship primitives, the corporate-design compliant schedule layouts and the standardized cross-company project data transfer (ProSTEP iViP’s CPM Recommendation).
It also shows planning and controlling processes with the use of the cybernetic view.
Last but not least it introduces the ProSTEP iViP Project Group „Project Schedule Management”.

Since the Skyliner was previewed at the IAA 2010, a number of customer test vehicles have been gathering operational experience in the fleets of international coach operators.
These customers ran the Skyliner on long-distance routes, for example – tailor-made deployment for the double-decker with up to 83 seats on its bright lower deck and panorama upper deck.
Operators are thus able to offer first-class connections between cities.
The consumption values of the Skyliners in customer trials amply demonstrated that this ride comfort can be combined with excellent economy: with a diesel consumption of under 30 litres per 100 kilometres, the premium double-decker displayed its high levels of efficiency.
The field trials prove that the calculated CO2 values of a minimal 12 grams per passenger-kilometre when fully loaded can even be bettered in practice.
The first of the Skyliners produced in series will be delivered from the beginning of 2012 on.
A great many orders have already been received for the new highlight in the top coach league.

The second new development was a seminar on complexity management as part of a management training course.
The programme was no less complex than the seminar title suggested. After all, the topic includes aspects of leadership, team building and crisis management.
Naturally, we felt it important to convey a more direct experience of complexity and train participants to deal with it by using interactive methods. What had been learned was immediately applied in two simulation games on the economic cycle and on a firm undergoing a serious crisis.
The development of strategies for solutions to complex problems in an everyday work situation marked the end of three intensive training days.

In addition, the authors of the report argue that protection against basic risks (e.g. health insurance and nursing care insurance), safeguarding of the standard of living (e.g. unemployment benefit and pension schemes) and the social services on offer should be appropriate to economic performance and should be guaranteed at a minimum level.
In the authors’ view, such a social union should be controlled not only by political-institutional means but also by both sides of industry and the social support organisations.

We owe the Ordo Rituum pro Ministerii Petrini Initio Romae Episcopi to the liturgical sense and the initiative of the Master and the Consultors of the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff.The tradition of a specific ritual for the inauguration of the Petrine ministry of the Bishop of Rome had been gradually lost in the papal celebrations of more recent times.
Although the process of simplifying papal rites begun by Vatican II had abolished certain ritual elements connected with the papal court and others which no longer corresponded to the new biblical-liturgical awareness - for example, the solemn coronation of the new Pontiff with the tiara, the rite “sic transit gloria mundi”, or the presentation of the keys of the Lateran Basilica - it had failed to identify and incorporate in the rites for the beginning of the pontificate signs and ritual actions capable of expressing the essence of the Petrine ministry “according to the norm of the holy Fathers”.
This meant that the “solemn inauguration of the ministry of the Pastor of the universal Church” celebrated for Popes John Paul I and John Paul II consisted in a solemn Mass in Saint Peter's Square, in which the new Pontiff was invested with the same pallium worn by metropolitan archbishops and received the obedience of the College of Cardinals.

Was my explaining it this way clear to you?
Let me ask you: With the way I’ve been speaking, do you understand it or not?
(Applause) There’s something I often mention, and I repeatedly emphasized it just yesterday: predestined relationship (yuan fen).
Many of us always want to introduce this Dafa to more people.
With some people, as soon as you introduce It to them they think It’s great and want to learn It themselves. These people probably have a predestined relationship.
With others, even your family members, when you introduce it to them, they don’t want to listen and they don’t believe it—they don’t believe it no matter what you say.
Let me tell you that they probably don’t have a predestined relationship.
Of course, this situation isn’t caused by the predestined-relationship form alone.
For some people it might be due to their poor enlightenment quality or large amounts of karma.

The young Finnish artist Mari Sunna deals with the condition of the human soul and also extreme states, in her figurative paintings.
The main focus of her motifs and her use of colour, in these at times grotesque and apparently fragile figures, is strangeness, fear and the unconscious, but also joy and exuberance.
Some of the tense bodies seem on the verge of explosion, other soft, fragile shapes seem to float, their tender faces swimming across the surface of the painting.
To achieve this variety and the fine graduations of these emotional states, Sunna uses a powerfully expressive, almost eruptive style as well but also a very soft style that avoids the use of impasto.

With this confession Paul also described the Greek word “Apostle”, which means a sent one or messenger.
He did not appoint himself to this office and neither was he called by other apostles or the High Council to be their envoy. Much more, his living Lord appeared to him personally and gave him his commission.
Paul was directly accountable to the risen Jesus, under whose continuous leading and certain protection he stood.
The missionary sent to the nations received no political office from any earthly lord. Rather, he was entrusted with a worldwide spiritual commission, which he fulfilled with authority, love and wisdom.
Above all he was to open the eyes of the non-Jews, so that they might recognize their sinful lostness.

The Armory, occupying the two large piers 90 and 92 at the Hudson River, felt more filtered and concentrated on painting, or maybe it was just easier to see the painting.

Still, there were lots of beaded curtains seen at the Whitney as well as one too many candelabras.

Redox flow batteries enable energy storage on a scale of kWh to MWh and provide the perfect solution for stationary applications.
They are well-suited as temporary storage for grid stabilization, industrial back-up power, integration of renewables such as wind and photovoltaic as well as off-grid power supply for mobile radio transmitters and remote households.
The main advantage of redox flow batteries is that they separate output (MW) and energy (MWh).
The two can be adjusted independently of one another and are easily adaptable to the specific requirements at hand.

Russia, how many misconceptions I had about this country.
The times when you had to walk the streets with a plastic bag instead of a daypack to cover your wealth are long gone.
Especially in the cities there is not much to be seen anymore of a desolate Russia.
Most city centres are newly renovated, the buildungs from the time before the revolution all shine, the stores are full with whatever you want, Russia is up and running.
The sins of the Soviet times can be seen outside the centre in the form of gray residental blocks in rows and smoking industral sites.
Less civilised it got as well when I left Russia's far east heading to the west.
The road is partly quite bad and where there never has been a road it's often just a long road works site.
I didn't ride the more than 2000km of unsealed road without any problems.
A big piece of rock tore a hole into the engine, some hundred kilometers away from the next town.
Luckily there was a road workers camp closeby where I was helped with liquid aluminium to close the hole as actually everything gets repaired in Russia.
At the other end in Chita you get back to civilisation hypnotised of endless long rides through the forests of the Russian taiga.
There's noch much choice crossing Siberia, from one city it's on to the other, Ulan-Ude, lake Baikal, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk.
In fact Siberia is by far not as lonesome as one might think as there is a railway for more than hundred years already.
Right now I'm in Tomsk, more or less on the latitude of Kazachstan's eastern end but at nearly 60 degrees nord.
It's almost only cold at night, the days having best autumn weather with clear skies and much sun.
There are 2000km to ride to get over the Ural mountains and thus after more than two years back to the European continent.
Soon I have to think about my return.
But until then I think there will be some chilly rides on the bike.

And so we see that here, in the State, as in all human things, everything depends on the fundamental characteristics of the mental attitude, not on cognition.
The mental attitude (Gesinnung *) is the rudder, it decides the direction and with the direction the goal — even though this should long remain invisible. The conflict in the State was now, as I hope I have shown, in the very first place such a struggle between two directions, i.e., between the steersmen.
As soon as the one had finally grasped the rudder firmly, the further development towards greater and greater freedom, more and more distinct nationalism and individualism, was natural and inevitable — just as inevitable as the contrary development of Caesarism and Papacy towards ever more restricted freedom.

In the United States, where a man who owns a million is referred to as being “worth” a million, market concepts have sunk in deeper than anywhere else.
Until quite recently Americans gave very little thought to the nature of economic relations.
In the land of the most powerful economic system economic theory continued to be exceedingly barren.
Only the present deep-going crisis of American economy has bluntly confronted public opinion with the fundamental problems of capitalist society.
In any event, whoever has not overcome the habit of uncritically accepting the ready-made ideological reflections of economic development, whoever has not reasoned out, in the footsteps of Marx, the essential nature of the commodity as the basic cell of the capitalist organism, will prove to be forever incapable of scientifically comprehending the most important and the most acute manifestations of our epoch.

In a context that is as poor as Casablanca is in terms of facilities dedicated to culture given its some five million inhabitants, it is particularly tempting to want to transpose the multiple experiences of European warehouses and factories converted into cultural spaces.
However, it is just as necessary to question the processes for applying these "models" in the Moroccan context in general and in Casablanca in particular.
And if the lack of cultural spaces often encounters factories and other abandoned buildings as evidence of this "lack," the principle of appropriating these spaces is not as evident.
Examples from certain European countries of often illegally occupied former factories incite the imagination but they are not possible in the Moroccan context where authorization, even informal, is required in such instances.
In Casablanca, developers and public authorities only despise these numerous abandoned sites until the day when an association expresses a desire to develop a cultural project that occupies these spaces.
And if it is true that, in the case of the former slaughterhouses, cultural activities were able to begin with the City’s request within the context of the elections, extracting an agreement that would allow a cultural project to stay for a number of years remains a power struggle that is still far from being won.

Minecraft as mentioned earlier is a sandbox building construction game.
The game was initially conceptualized and developed by Markus Persson, his company (Mojang) is still improving on the features of this interactive game.
The user or player of the game is required to build any imaginable structure of geometrical shape using textured blocks or cubes during the day.
During the night, the monsters come out, and the structures need to have been constructed or erected before they emerge as a result of providing shelter against the monsters.
The game was developed to be used on Java platform and Java Applet.
Since its inception in May, 2009, the game has become popular in the world of virtualization.
This is because of its numerous features and the three dimensional effect.

Sergio Frau insists on the authority of Dicaearchus (It 273 / Ge ---) and tries by wild calculations to decipher any sense in the numbers handed down to us from antiquity.
He does not reach any palpable result: "Niente di definitivo, certo ..." (It 282 ff. / Ge ---).
It is legitimate to search for a sense behind such nonsense numbers, yet if you cannot find any reasonable sense, then it is an open question, or it is a mistake and an error, which is well-known from ancient geography.
But you cannot take this as evidence for a re-localization of the Pillars of Hercules.

So we can then assume from that that you do need to regain your ability to do Telepathy.
And to improve it.
And the reason I say regain and improve is because Telepathy is not something that is pasted onto you like a science or a schoolbook study or some new acquisition.
It is something that you have the inherent ability to do just as when you are a child you have the ability inherently to talk.
You only must learn the words, you only must learn how to do it with the air and the throat and the sounds.
So it is with Telepathy.

More than two millennia ago, asafetida was already in use in Europe: Legend has it that it was encountered by the soldiers of Alexander the Great on their march through Central Asia.
The conquests of Alexander opened trade routes that made Eastern commodities available in the Mediterranean region, and like black pepper, asafetida established itself quickly on the new market.
It was used in ancient Greek and Roman cuisines, often as a substitute for the expensive North African silphion.
After the latter’s extinction, asafetida became even more common, and continued to be used though the early Middle Ages (for example, to flavour barbecued mutton in France). Later, however, its popularity ceased: After the 16.th century, it is no more mentioned in European cookbooks.

If people abandon the striving for what arouses their lusts, they will certainly create conditions for arising heavenly coexistence on the earth.
However, they escalate their lusts instead, because they say it is a token of rationalism, cleverness, wisdom, and intellectual development.
That is why they have to pay for those merits of theirs with slavery, suffering, harvesting hatred, heresy, and evil.
I wonder if people let themselves advise on these evident relations.
I am sure they will keep on thinking they have risen above the supposed stupidity that has been only the plainness of believers, people better and more merciful in their characters.

On March 25th and 26th, several meetings took place in Dresden for political purposes. I was sent to them as a delegate from Leipsic, the question of unity being one of the points on the order of business.
As a delegate from Leipsic, I spoke in favor of united action, but Vahlteich made the mistake of sharply attacking the members of the General Association of German Workingmen and overwhelming them with reproaches, thereby calling forth a storm of resentment.
Vahlteich could not forget the treatment which he had received in his former capacity as Lassalle’s secretary at the hands of the General Association of German Workingmen. He had been expelled from it on a motion of Lassalle, who could not bear any contradiction.
So he slammed the Association whenever an opportunity offered. Nevertheless, the close of those meetings led to a joint conference, in which the workingmen’s clubs of Leipsic, Dresden, Chemnitz, Glauchau and Goerlitz, the members of the General Association of German Workingmen of Dresden, Plauenscher Grund, Chemnitz and Glauchau, the old journeyman’s club and the Typographia of Dresden, were represented by twenty delegates.
It was decided to begin a joint agitation for universal suffrage, for a democratic right of association and assembly, for the right of free locomotion, for professional freedom, for the abolition of passport limitations, for the introduction of school reform, for maintenance of schools by the state, regulation of wages, of sick and death benefit funds, and of associations.
The delegates present constituted themselves into a committee.

The government, however, shows more attention, and rightly so, in protecting us from any circumstance."

In an open letter on March 15, Erich Kleiber protests against the removal of the inscription »Fridericus Rex Apollini et Musis« on the Lindenoper architrave. He resigns from his contract, having realized that »an unbiased artistic expression will no longer be possible in the future«.
On April 22, Franz Konwitschny (1901-1962) is appointed executive general music director of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin.
On June 14, Hans Löwlein conducts the final Staatsoper performance at Admiralspalast: Mozart´s »Die Entführung aus dem Serail«.
On September 4, the resurrected Lindenoper is reopened with Wagner´s »Meistersinger von Nürnberg «, conducted by Franz Konwitschny.
Further conductors are Lovro von Matacic (1899-1983) until 1958, Horst Stein (b.

The residents in attendance selected the concept 'The Dream' as the basis for project realisation.
The results of this public consultation were reported by the landscape architects back to the local playground committee.
But the residents were not only involved in the consultation process; they also participated (particularly the more active young people) in the construction of the playground.
There were two 'Action Days' on which, under the supervision of the playground equipment manufacturer, they were able to put the finishing touches to the equipment. Nets were hung, swings were mounted and the final wood elements inserted and screwed in place.
The planting was also undertaken with the help of the local residents - willow cuttings were put in the ground and protective fencing put around them.

In 1993, we decided to look for a course of the Kung Fu of the Master Chang Dsu Yao guided by the wild enthusiasm for the Kung Fu films watched on TV.
In the following years, also thanks to the books read on Martial Arts, we started having the clear idea and comprehension that Kung Fu is a proper Art, based both on a proper philosophy and ancient traditions.
Nowadays we are practicing the Kung Fu (Shaolin and Tai Chi) of the Master Chang Dsu Yao with the commitment to go on spreading it abroad being as closer as possible to the original teachings.

Glass fibres are used for thermal and sound insulation, for woven textile fabrics and as glass fibre reinforced plastics.
Although glass fibre reinforced plastics are very cost-effective they are still a high quality fibre-plastic compound.
In applications where very high mechanical stresses are present, glass fibre reinforced plastics are used exclusively as continuous fibres in woven fabrics or in uni-directional tapes.
Compared with fibre-plastic compounds made with other reinforcing fibres, glass fibre reinforced plastic has a relatively low modulus of elasticity.
Even in the direction of the fibre, it is less than that of aluminium.
One advantage of glass fibre in combination with a compatible plastic matrix is its high breaking elongation and elastic energy absorption.
Even in an aggressive environment, glass fibre reinforced plastic has excellent corrosion behaviour.

During the Fifth Meeting of the Pre-Synodal Council, held in Rome, 16 - 18 March 1999, the Pre-Synodal Council, in possession of all the material submitted to the General Secretariat from the preparatory stage, proceeded, with the help of experts from Europe, to propose a final draft of this working document.
At this meeting, the members studied the initial draft composed on the basis of the responses and structured according to the main topics suggested in the questions of the Lineamenta.
The observations of the members of the Pre-Synodal Council at this meeting were then incorporated into the various parts of the final text, which was later submitted to the Holy Father for his approval.

Lightweight extrusion profiles with reinforcement elements are promising news in the domain of lightweight construction.
The machining of them suffers from several problems: Aside from the question of choosing a suitable tool, feed rate, and milling strategy, an excessive rise in temperature could lead to stress and even a distortion due to the differing thermal expansion of the reinforcement material and the surrounding matrix material.
For certain milling applications like seal surfaces, a certain roughness of the manufactured surface is necessary.
In many other cases, a smooth surface of very high quality is desirable.
Available simulation systems usually completely lack the simulation of dynamic effects, which have a great effect on the final surface quality, and therefore are not able to predict the resulting surface quality.
In this paper simulation methods are presented that are capable of simulating the dynamic behavior of the tool in the milling process and the resulting flank and ground surface structures. Additionally, a fast temperature simulation for heterogeneous workpieces with reinforcement elements, which is based on the finite difference method and cellular automata, is introduced.

So these initiatives have taken his hand to the bishops, which, or naively seduced or intimidated in front of such intrusive, powerful and sometimes threatening effervescence, does not deprive the rest of the good sides, have come to assume certain not everyone welcomes the role outlined above by Rahner, yielding to excessive indulgence or tolerance of mistakes and bad behaviors that were spreading.

That’s not all. Instead of many different locking systems, a single online system serves as a control centre for all tasks at SimonsVoss.
Transponders are configured for new employees and blocked when lost. Thanks to the LSM software (Locking System Management), such modifications or extensions are now quickly implemented.
“Unlike before, we can now also re-programme everything very easily at a later stage. That gives us optimum flexibility and security,” declares Seyferth, “Our alarm system is also activated and deactivated using a transponder.
When called out on an emergency, fire fighters can simply turn the alarm system off by pressing a button. We no longer a need to waste time fiddling about with the alarm system controls.
The Smart Relay, a type of access control reader, acts as an intelli-gent interface during this process. Third-party systems, such as alarm systems, time and attendance systems or even canteen payment systems can be conveniently inte-grated into the SimonsVoss system via this interface for both new systems and up-grades alike.

Especially heavy points were made against the head of the government of the day, Stürmer.
The latter was made the symbol of the Germanophile tendencies in court circles and was suspected of direct treachery. The predatory, conquering greed of Russian liberalism, which demanded the Straits and Constantinople, also expressed itself quite sharply in Milyukov’s speech.
The speech gave rise to a multitude of interpretations and prompted talk of a duel and the prosecution of Milyukov by Stürmer; the fall of the Stürmer cabinet, which followed soon after, was also attributed to it.
Its publication was prohibited but that did not prevent its eager distribution by illegal means.
