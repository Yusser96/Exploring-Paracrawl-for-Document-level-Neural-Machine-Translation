Jeff Rocha, EAW Vice President and General Manager, stated, “Our partners, Lab.gruppen and Powersoft have developed new firmware for their DSP-enabled amplifiers that allows direct importation of standard EAW Greybox files – the very same files that you can currently load into an EAW UX8800 Digital Signal Processor.
This brings the power of EAW Focusing to a wider range of hardware platforms and provides a huge advantage for end users in terms of compatibility and consistency.
Any files that we have created to date and any files that we will create moving forward will be fully compatible with both manufacturer’s DSP enabled amplifier platforms."
Rocha emphazises, "By partnering directly with Lab.gruppen and Powersoft, we’ve been able to work directly with them to re-architect their firmware such that either manufacturer can directly load the same native EAW Greybox as the UX8800.”

The first step to business ventures in China is generally associated with high costs in terms of time and money.
Accordingly, attention should be placed on the initial preparations and details. Snap decisions seldom pay off.
Apart from expertise in one's field of business, it is just as important to have a solid understanding of the Chinese culture and a general knowledge of the Chinese market and the economic situation.

If you maintain that the same quantity of labour exists in things made equal in exchange, and that these things must be reducible to equal amounts of labour, you are claiming for these conditions an existence in the real world and not merely in thought.
Marx's former line of argument, we must bear in mind, would have been quite impossible if by the side of it he had wished to propound, for actual exchange relations, the dogma that products of unequal amounts of labour exchange, on principle, with each other. If he had admitted this notion (and the conflict with facts with which I reproach him lies just in his not admitting it), he would certainly have come to quite different conclusions.
Either he would have been obliged to declare that the so-called equalisation in exchange is no true equation, and does not admit of the conclusion that "a common factor of equal magnitude" is present in the exchanged things, or he would have been obliged to come to the conclusion that the sought-for common factor of equal magnitude is not, and could not be labour.
In any case it would have been impossible for him to have continued to reason as he did.

This technique is relevant under other two profiles: What we see are interrogation comments, cute little typically, other characters involved, they almost look like the typical country comments and gossip; personal observations and interpretations that make gigantic details, snap judgments and sharp jokes: once again, little white lies, but they are the frame of a murder.
The other reason why it is worth dwelling on the interrogation scenes is more technical: are included within the main narrative almost had a comment, approaching the series more than anything in the style of a documentary; seems to follow the news of women's lives in Monterey helped by expert commentary Super partes.
This almost documentary style is the signature of Director Jean-Marc Vallée (Wild, with the strong performance just by Reese Witherspoon), It is also found in other situations: the most significant of all is that of couples therapy that undergo Celeste (Nicole Kidman) and Perry (Alexander Skarsgård); the scenes are particularly long, full of silences and glances, so much as to seem almost real time scenes, senza che sia intervenuto nessun montaggio e nessuna post-produzione.

After a few words of welcome from Andreas Mößner, director of sheetfed offset sales, the head of sheetfed offset marketing, Jürgen Veil, presented a chronology of the developments for direct corrugated printing with the Rapida sheetfed offset presses since 1998.
In order to guarantee users flexibility in their market activities, the prime objective was from the very beginning to base all solutions on a standard press configuration, which would then at most be supplemented by corresponding accessories for commercial, packaging or direct-printed corrugated applications.
From a new, shaftless feeder, a range of double-sheet sensors, dust extraction systems and special board guides and sheet-edge rollers for scratch-free sheet travel, right up to full-scale automated logistics systems, Jürgen Veil described some of the countless details through which the Rapida technology is practically predestined for packaging and direct corrugated printing.
The quality of direct printing on corrugated materials is served especially by the facility for fully automatic configuration of a kiss-print setting via the Ergotronic control console.

Did Moses descend from the mountain top with the 10 Commandments carved in stone, having spoken to a burning bush?
Yes and no.
Moses often climbed mountain tops, which in the desert are more like hills, and did so to get the view.
When he relayed that he spoke with an entity in the bushes, which he could not make out but which was of such bright light that he could scarcely look at it, how did this translate over time?
The bush was so bright ... folks who had never seen an entity in light form could only assume a fire.
And did Moses descend with the 10 Commandments written in stone?
This was the last thing Moses would have been inclined to do, as he was not a control freak or given to hauling stone tablets around on top of all his other burdens.
This story was cooked up later, and attributed to Moses, who was no longer around to refute it.
Unlike Jesus, who spoke to the masses in many places and repeated his messages, Moses had few followers.
The lie grew larger than the truth, as there were few to speak the truth.

After all these years, it still amazes how Americans can remain so disconnected from the world events in which we play so central a role.
I use the term "world events" loosely, since the US today seems to have lost even its historically tenuous connections with the reality of the rest of the world.
We continue to call our baseball championships the World Series, oblivious to how quaint and naive, at best--or arrogant and self-absorbed, at worst--it has always seemed to the rest of the world.
This has been the hallmark of Americans' role in the world--a curious blend of ubiquitous involvement paired with near-total ignorance.

The handling of steel sheets is dominated by classical, mechanical load handling attachments which usually consist of hooks, chains, ropes and belts.
These attachments are comparatively heavy and unwieldy but are convincing regarding design, quality and reliability.
However, this technology offers very little potential for innovation and process optimisation.
The research focuses on the development of innovative magnet systems regarding the above mentioned boundaries, restrictions and requirements. Typical handling problems will be solved and the necessity of permanent maintenance will be reduced.
Altogether, the handling of steel products will be faster, safer and gentle to material.

Frequently, many who present themselves for catechesis truly require genuine conversion.
Because of this the Church usually desires that the first stage in the catechetical process be dedicated to ensuring conversion.
(185) In the "missio ad gentes", this task is normally accomplished during the 'pre-catechumenate'.
(186) In the context of "new evangelization" it is effected by means of a "kerygmatic catechesis", sometimes called "pre-catechesis", (187) because it is based on the precatechumenate and is proposed by the Gospel and directed towards a solid option of faith.
Only by starting with conversion, and therefore by making allowance for the interior disposition of "whoever believes", can catechesis, strictly speaking, fulfil its proper task of education in the faith.

It is easy to understand that there will be an organization unlike capitalist organization when the proletariat will have become a society, a total collective owner of all the means of production (mines, factories, etc.), of everything which had previously been “property”, when everything belongs to everyone in common.
But before reaching that point, the proletariat creates—and does so all the more effectively the more conscious it is of its forming a class—forms of expression, organs, which incarnate class consciousness, social consciousness, the consciousness of mutual solidarity.
When this form of organization becomes a revolutionary process, it is called council organization.

This list became known as the GNU task list.
In addition to missing Unix components, we listed added various other useful software and documentation projects that, we thought, a truly complete system ought to have.

Integrated newsrooms have been in existence in North America for 10 years but they are no panacea for commercial success.

Willys began experimenting with a civilian jeep (CJ) version in 1944, the first one being the CJ-2.
They were almost identical to the Willys MB with the major exceptions being larger headlights, a column shifter, and side mounted spare tires.
They were oftentimes referred to as Agrijeeps and there were only about 36 actually produced.
Willys was targeting the farming community with their first efforts to introduce the Jeep into the civilian population.
The first real commercial effort of the Jeep was the CJ-2A, which was manufactured from 1945-49.
From looking at advertisements for the CJ-2A you can see that these first civilian Jeeps were being sold primarily as an all- purpose vehicle to the American farmer, and hence the name Agrijeep for the CJ-2.

Travertine has been used in Turkey throughout its long history.
In almost all the Roman settlements inside Turkey, Travertine was widely used in different applications.
Cities like Hierapolis, near Denizli, were built completely with Travertine.
The Roman engineers often used local building materials in their constructions and Travertine became a common building material.
In the modern age, hundreds, if not thousands, of projects have been done using Travertine.

Only after you have safely stored the original kernel should you unpack the newest kernel: you will see that the file linux-2.4.6.tar.bz2 unpacks everything in the 'linux' directory by default.
It is overwritten if this directory already exists, and then you have problems: you can no longer recompile the original kernel, you lost the original configuration, etc. In this example I rename the 'linux' directory right after unpacking the kernel source code 'linux-2.4.6', and I create a symbolic link with the name 'linux' to the directory 'linux-2.4.6'.
The advantage of this procedure is that you can see the system's present kernel version immediately.
In addition it is easier to install a kernel upgrade.

Squeak, squeak, cried a little mouse at the kitchen door; it was the fourth, and not the third, of the four who were contending for the prize, one whom the rest supposed to be dead. She shot in like an arrow, and overturned the sausage peg that had been covered with crape.
She had been running day and night. She had watched an opportunity to get into a goods train, and had travelled by the railway; and yet she had arrived almost too late.
She had lost her sausage skewer, but not her voice; for she began to speak at once as if they only waited for her, and would hear her only, and as if nothing else in the world was of the least consequence. She spoke out so clearly and plainly, and she had come in so suddenly, that no one had time to stop her or to say a word while she was speaking.

It's not only written texts, but pictures too, that is scanned photographs and videos, which play an important role in the World Wide Web.
These too function mostly according to the traditional model, namely as a kind of quasi-reference.
They interrupt the flow of references and represent artificial end points of menus, i.e. impasses in hyperspace.
There are however on the Net more skilled forms of picture presentation which are more appropriate to the hypertext medium.
This involves furnishing different areas of the picture with "source anchors" which respectively refer to various "destination anchors".
The picture itself then functions as a hypertext.
If I activate a link within an picture I am refered to other pictures, written texts, or Chat programms.
The picture no longer appears as the referent and termination of a menu, but becomes a sign itself with references to other signs.
In the same way as written hypertexts, hypertextual pictures serve as semiotic intersections in the unending referential framework of cyberspace.

The few faithful builders upon the true foundation.
(1 Corinthians 3:10, 11) were perplexed and hindered as the rubbish of false doctrine obstructed the work.
Like the builders upon the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah's day, some were ready to say: "The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build." Nehemiah 4:10.
Wearied with the constant struggle against persecution, fraud, iniquity, and every other obstacle that Satan could devise to hinder their progress, some who had been faithful builders became disheartened; and for the sake of peace and security for their property and their lives, they turned away from the true foundation.
Others, undaunted by the opposition of their enemies, fearlessly declared: "Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible" (verse 14); and they proceeded with the work, everyone with his sword girded by his side.
Ephesians 6:17.

We use them as spacers or end beads before the bead tips. While the color is exceptionally hard to wear off glazed beads due to the high temperature used when firing the glaze onto the ceramic base, glazed beads nevertheless tend to chip more readily than other ceramic beads.
Small chips may exist. These are beads with 4mm large holes, very individually shaped--not for perfectionists.

Today the extensive area comprising a number of buildings is in bad condition and desperately needs renovation.
Since the structure is quite unsafe it is officially closed to the general public, but access can be gained easily.
And even though it may not seem likely from a distance, it is no problem to drive almost up to the ruins; the track itself can hardly be made out, and you get the feeling you are waltzing around in the middle of a field, but you can get there in a normal car.

The best way to detect an incursion is to look for modified, missing, or unexpected files.
The best way to look for modified files is from another (often centralized) limited-access system.
Writing your security scripts on the extra-secure limited-access system makes them mostly invisible to potential attackers, and this is important.
In order to take maximum advantage you generally have to give the limited-access box significant access to the other machines in the business, usually either by doing a read-only NFS export of the other machines to the limited-access box, or by setting up ssh key-pairs to allow the limited-access box to ssh to the other machines.
Except for its network traffic, NFS is the least visible method -- allowing you to monitor the file systems on each client box virtually undetected.
If your limited-access server is connected to the client boxes through a switch, the NFS method is often the better choice.
If your limited-access server is connected to the client boxes through a hub, or through several layers of routing, the NFS method may be too insecure (network-wise) and using ssh may be the better choice even with the audit-trail tracks that ssh lays.

The operations of metwpjaj'oy lobe the brain is divided in a lot of departments or lobes.
The each lobe has concrete operations.
Pj'sw ap’ the forehead they are the metwpjaj'oj or frontal lobes.
For facility, we were reported in the right and left winger lobe, collective as “to metwpjaj'o lovo'”.
It is the bigger lobe of brain.
It is the place of crisis, logic, intelligence and will.
It is the centre of control of entire our existence.
Certain scientists are reported in the metwpjaj'o lobe as “Korw'na” the brain.
The studies show that the named this “Korw'na” carries out a variety from vital operations.
Certain ap these are found in list in table 2. the spirituality, the character, the moral and will are the characteristics that us give our unique individuality.
Consequently, a individual with destroyed metwpjaj'o lobe resembles the himself, as he was always, but if you come in communication with him, it is usually obvious that “apla' he is not j'djos”.
The book of books is reported in the importance of metwpjaj'oy lobe in order to we know the god.
The last book of Saint Writing makes a provocative statement, that is mentioned in table 3.
This text shows that the character of god [ the name of ], is repeated in our character [ explains with examples ap the frontal lobe, that is precisely behind ap forehead ].
The SIZE of BRAIN AND OPERATION It is fascinating we observe that the size of metwpjaj'oy lobe differs between the persons and various animals.
It is the metwpjaj'os lobe that mainly separates persons ap’ the animals, as appear in the table 4. Those that have the smaller metwpjaj'oys lobes have limited ways of life moved ap the instinct.
Those that have bigger metwpjaj'oys lobes are capable to carry out complexer operations.
Ga'tes, with 3,5% of only brain in the metwpjaj'o lobe, they are limited in crisis and logic.
They have a a lot of limited faculty n’ they analyze information and to make crises based on new information, thus, they are based basically on the instinct.
The dogs are more ekpajdey'sjmoj because the 7% ap their brain are found in the metwpjaj'o lobe.
Ana'mesa in the animals, hjmpatzi'des they have bigger metwpjaj'o lobe - up to the 17% of their brain.
The persons, ap the other side, have, 33% of their brain in the metwpjaj'o lobe.
Certain animals have other departments of brain that are more developed ap what the human beings.
For example, comparatively with the animals, hjmpatzi'des they have much bigger cerebellums in the region of brain that checks co-ordination [ of movement ].
This has reasonable base, because hjmpatzi'des they need a lot of good balance and agility in order to they are shaken and they jump from tree in tree.
The birds have also very well developed cerebellums in order to they fly, they are landed and they chase.
All these activities require a high level of co-ordination. ¢lla animals can have one richer occipital lobe [ lobe in the rear department of brain ] the centre of brain, where it finds or sight.
Gj’ this reason their sight of is generally much better ap that of persons.
Still other animals have more developed the pla'gjoys lobes.
However, for the persons, the difference is found in the clearly much bigger metwpjaj'oys lobes.
Thus, we have the faculty for high intellectual thought and superior training faculty.
In order to we appreciate completely the importance of metwpjaj'wn lobes he is precious we still examine few cases ap’ the chronicles of medical history.
A ap’ reasons gj’ this is that the Fjne'as lost only department of his frontal lobes.
The choices in the way of life can influence entire our metwpjaj'oys lobes - with more dramatic ways ap that the loss of Fjne'a.

Audi relies on efficiency and reliability for its tenth appearance in Le Mans.
The Audi R10 TDI, now in its third year of service, is no longer the fastest prototype on the grid – at least over a single lap.
However, over the distance Audi Sport Team Joest has a good chance of winning because in Le Mans it’s all about losing as little time as possible in the pits.
That the more than 650 hp V12 TDI engine is particularly efficient and economical is well-known.
The same goes for the reliability of the R10 TDI: A 30-hour endurance test in April ran without problems.
In addition, the car is designed so that it can be repaired in the shortest possible time after collisions or accidents.

Do you want to be a man or woman of God?
Do you want the hand of God on your life?
Then you'll drink your cup of pain and bathe your bed in tears.
You'll weep not so much from feeling physical pain, but from a pain that's much worse.
It's the pain of being bruised and rejected by friends - the pain that parents feel when teenagers trample their hearts and become strangers to them.
It's the pain that fills the hearts of husbands and wives when walls of silence are built up and first love disappears.

Since June 1997 245 patients of our Eye Department with central choroidal neovascularisation, which would not benefit from argon laser therapy, underwent a photonbeam therapy of the macula with a total dose of 16 or 20 Gy.
The fluorescence angiographies were performed prior to and, as well as three and twelve months after radiotherapy.
Each image was calibrated by manual setting of reference points at three characteristic bifurcations of the retinal vessels.
Then areas of interest were calculated by a software designed for this purpose.
A semiquantitative follow up was possible by comparing the findings three and twelve months after therapy with the image prior to radiotherapy.

It is an open question whether lemon grass was already known in antiquity, as many aromatics of ancient texts have not yet been identified.
A possible candidate is the Biblical qaneh [ קָנֶה ] which appears to denote a kind of grassy plant or reed; if often occurs in the meaning branch.
Yet on some occasions, it is listed among aromatics (e. g., in the Song of Songs) and there are not so many grass-shaped aromatic plants to chose from.
Conservative wisdom has it translated calamus, but lemon grass would also appear a possibility.

The main feature of this medieval town, which stands on the Sienese border between the regions of Umbria and Lazio, is its wealth of hot spring water, numbering as many as 42 springs.
The waters here were already known in Roman times (Oratius alludes to their therapeutic qualities). The main economic activity is related to hot springwater tourism and to "agritourism" which thrives thanks to the unspoilt woods and countryside.
Today, a new building stands next to the former spa centre where it is possible to have a variety of mud and water treatments.
In the near vicinity the swimming pool is filled with hot spring water at 40°C. It is worth visiting the fairy-tale castle of Fighine.
Traditional festivals include: the "Sagra dei Pici" - a homemade pasta speciality - in Celle sul Rigo, a village built on the site of a former fortress.
The festival is held on the last Sunday in May.
In San Casciano the "Sagra del Ciaffagnone" takes place on the first Sunday in June.
The other frazione of Palazzone is wellknows for its wine festival and its strong Chianti Colli Senesi wine.

Thomas Kolle has no doubts after this test: "Saving on the number of passes, increased laying output by 15%.
The test has convinced me and my people to change to BOMAG machines in future.
The easy operation was also impressive.
It meant that even my experienced operators worked more efficiently." BOMAG ECONOMIZER passed the test in Koblenz with flying colours, and is proving it's worth to the industry.
Ultimately the system increases efficiency on site (and the system also highlights soft spots) and also guarantees consistently high quality workmanship.

Recall that in the first six months of this year the port terminals of the Middle East have moved a total of 26.2 million containers, an increase of 11% in the first half of 2010 (of 26 July 2011).
"Historically - said the DP World CEO Mohammed Sharaf - there has always been more activity in the second half of the year compared to the first half.
However, as we anticipated in July, there is uncertainty about the global economic outlook, which makes it more difficult to forecast the development of world trade in the second half of the year.
So far the impact of this uncertainty has not been felt in the markets where we operate and, given our focus on emerging markets more resilient, still expect to achieve results for the full year in line with expectations. "

Jürg Fedier, interim Chief Executive Officer since 14 March 2013, will resume full-time financial leadership of the Group as CFO during the first quarter of 2014.
Mr. Fedier, 2012 Swiss CFO of the year, was instrumental in Oerlikon’s transformational 2010 balance sheet restructuring and the architect of the Group’s 2012 comprehensive and successful refinancing.

On the 17thofOctober District Apostle Studer and those accompanying him arrived in Chisinau.
Together with him were four members of the youth from Switzerland.
During the same evening a church in Cigarleni was dedicated.
According to the Moldavian tradition members greeted him with wonderfully plaited loaves of bread, salt and wine.
On the 18thofOctober two Divine Services were held (in Sângerei and Bender).
Furthermore a fountain was dedicated in one of the suburban areas, which could be built through charity funds received from the New Apostolic Church Switzerland.
The next day the District Apostle held Divine Service in Cahul and afterwards could hand over the key for a Kindergarten which was renovated through collections and fund raising done by the Swiss youth.
The four young people reported to the congregation on how this money was raised.
On the 20th of October there was joyful fellowship in the 'Sala cu organ' festive hall.
The occasion celebrated the 10thanniversary of the founding of the New Apostolic Church in Moldavia.
Since then we have 5districts, 47congregations and over 3500members.
After the Divine Service a small concert was held by some of the brethren for the members of the congregation and others related stories from the initial missionary work.
The District Apostle and the accompanying brothers made themselves available to the brethren for personal conversations.
In the afternoon a Ministers and wives Service took place.
The following day and after having met with the District Leaders and employees of the administration office the time to travel home had come.
In total 83souls could be sealed, 16ministers could be ordained and a Wedding Blessing given during the visit.

However, Juliana s team did not subject the tracks to a contemporary house beat, which has already been done far too often.
Rather, Aquino relocates the scandal-ridden dance temple Studio 54 from New York to Copacabana to a South American open-air environment, preferably to the sandy beach, where there is a pleasantly warm breeze in the evenings.
Here, the sweat-inducing disco classics get a cool and explicitly sensual touch of South America.
The rhythmic base of the adaptations rests on a sophisticated blend of Bossa Nova and samba; the feeling is lively and easy-going.
The interpretation sometimes sounds almost jazzy for example in the opener Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood .
Incidentally, this number by Santa Esmeralda, rearranged in a virtuoso manner, was first sung long before the disco era.
None other than Nina Simone lent this composition her voice in 1964.
A few months before, Bossa Nova from Rio had conquered the world in the form of the legendary Girl From Ipanema .
Aquino s superb interpretation brings Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood back to its roots to a certain extent.
It is not for nothing that TV Globo has selected Aquino s new version as the theme tune for a Brazilian soap entitled Páginas Da Vida (Pages of life).

‘Beyond Federation: Options to renew Australia’s 1901 Constitution,’ has been prepared to improve the knowledge of its readers about constitutional matters, and to encourage them as a matter of urgency to participate in producing a new Constitution which will ensure that our nation will become a fully sovereign twenty-first century democracy at last.
Our new national Constitution must be democratically designed to lead Australia into the future. In doing this, it must also consider the views of those who are not yet entitled to vote, and anticipate the forecast needs of future citizens.
It should set out the peoples’ rights and responsibilities, display to all the philosophy on which management of our nation is based, spell out the principles by which members of our government must be guided, encourage them to discard adversarial politics and accept that it is their responsibility to unite our nation, not to divide it. Our national Constitution should be presented in a form readable by the people, so that they can relate to it, understand it, and support it.

It is the production and reproduction of that means of production so indispensable to the capitalist: the labourer himself. The individual consumption of the labourer, whether it proceed within the workshop or outside it, whether it be part of the process of production or not, forms therefore a factor of the production and reproduction of capital; just as cleaning machinery does, whether it be done while the machinery is working or while it is standing.
The fact that the labourer consumes his means of subsistence for his own purposes, and not to please the capitalist, has no bearing on the matter. The consumption of food by a beast of burden is none the less a necessary factor in the process of production, because the beast enjoys what it eats.

In combination with the complete discontinuation of regular travel agency services this results in improved margins between revenue and profit.
Gross sales for 2001 will, because of the separations of eHotel and Travel Service, be reduced by approximately EURO 15 million, while the gross profit will only be affected marginally and the operative results will be strengthened.
From January 1, 2001 onwards i:FAO will discontinue to report - as usual in the travel industry - gross sales.
This will adapt i:FAO Aktiengesellschaft's reporting principles to those of the software industry.

There hasn’t been a concrete catalyst as there have been no economic data releases of note during the European session.
It seems like FX and stock markets are taking their cue from the bond markets as Portuguese 10-year yields fell to their lowest level since March 2011 at 8.01%.
The rally in Portuguese sovereign bond markets comes just ahead of its 2013 Budget, which is presented later today.
A transaction tax and a hike in income tax are some of the changes expected. However, in an environment of weak growth and rising unemployment, which is at a record high of 15%, the budget gap is unlikely to be plugged by hiking taxes alone, thus more spending cuts are also expected to be announced.

The different kinds of paper used by PANTONE® contain many optic brighteners.
Especially in case of spectral photometric measurements, this may lead to problems.
Optical brighteners convert radiant energy in the UV area (400-480 nm) into visible light which is more in the bluish area.
Paper with optical brighteners appear more bluish and therefore cleaner than paper without optical brighteners.
Of course, this also influences the colour shade.
Often optical brighteners lead to special problems as they dissolve very fast under the influence of UV and then the paper appears more yellowish and dirtier.
Therefore, products on these printing substrates wear out and yellow faster.

If we are once in Zeebrugge a trip to Brugge may not miss.
After breakfast we take the "Kusttram" to Blankenberge.
In this lively bath we have nearly an hour to wait for the train to Brugge.
We take this time to have a short look into town and a original Belgian beer at noon.
Whow, they really put 11% alcohol in this!
The taste - well you first have to get used to it.
A modern train brings us to Brugge within 10 minutes after that.
While being on our way to the city center we first have a stop at a nice garden restaurant.
There we have Pasta Pest for Axel and Bordje Fintje Hapjes for Brit for lunch.
Very tasty and the romantic atmosphere in the garden where we eat it is wonderful to have.
After that we move further on to the mediaval streets.
The status as Unesco world heritage is well earned.
A visit is worth spending here.
And even more if you like chocolate and pralines.
One shop after the other sell those sweeties.
We resist buying some and better take a boat tour through the internal channels of Brugge.
In half an hour its like riding through the channels of Amsterdam.
Wonderful houses to the left and the right.
And we can see even our movie team from yesterday again.
Regarding the guide of the boat tour they are making a Belgium police movie here.
After the tour we walk further on through the streets by feet.
The town is very lively.
On every corner is a bistro or cafe where the people sit outside and enjoy the sun.
At 4.34 p.m. we take the train back to Blankenberge and further on the tram to Zeebrugge.
At the Spar supermarket near the church we buy some strawberries, tomatoes and so on. Also the fish market around the corner cannot resist us.
We buy deliciuos scampis pan, "Garnaalsalade" and a piece of Loup de mer there.
Let's see what we can make of it.

5 The method of fighting a cause not only directly but also by destroying it by exaggeration is not quite a new one.
A personality cult which does not describe the objective role of a certain person who drives the cause forward, but credits him with in a way miraculous qualities, so that he cannot be but obeyed, thwarts the Cultural Revolution completely.
If the majority accepts such an “authority”, if an individual is put in the place of the forward-driving role of the people, then somebody may just occupy that place or inherit it in order to erect the dictatorship against the masses, the bourgeois and bureaucratic-bourgeois dicatorship.
Such a personality cult thwarts the critical and independent thinking, the furthering of which was the true intention of the Cultural Revolution.
An essential result is that this attempt of such an adverse line as Lin Biao’s has failed.

The general strike, as the name itself already indicates, has for its goal the inclusion, in so far as it is possible, of the entire proletariat.
The CGT includes in its ranks probably not more than 5 to 8 per cent of the proletariat.
The influence of the CGT itself outside the confines of the trade unions is absolutely insignificant to the extent that on general questions it does not equal the influence of the working-class parties.
Is it possible, for example, to compare the influence of Le Peuple to the influence of Le Populaire or l’Humanité?

The offline programming of the robot systems is carried out using the Cloos RoboPlan software.
While the system is in production, a new program can be simultaneously produced in RoboPlan.
The software enables welding, search, travel paths and tools to be defined on 3-D models to which the welding parameters and further functions required for the running of the programme are then added. with the resulting program only then being transferred via a network connection to the robot controller and only optimised at the workplace.

Lena will perform six songs in each of the two semi-final "Our Song for Germany" shows.
Stefan Raab will judge the songs in his role as President of the jury made up of representatives from the music and entertainment world.
Sabine Heinrich and Matthias OpdenhÃ¶vel will present the shows.
Viewers can then vote for three songs from each of the semi-final shows on ProSieben by telephone and SMS. The winning six songs will then be performed again in the final on Das Erste.
The TV audience will then decide which song Lena will sing live on stage on Saturday, May 14 at the Eurovision Song Contest in DÃ¼sseldorf.
The grand final of the ESC will also be shown live on Das Erste.

“Today, I want to say a special Thanks to Mary for all those who, in their own way, have responded to her call.
It is good for us to know that Mary is underlining how much we are important for her, and that she can do nothing without us. … God wanted each one of us in the time and in the surroundings in which we live.
He wanted us and he gave us the graces, so that through them we may serve him. … If God has thought that we could serve him better in another time and in another place, he would have not placed us here but there. … Open your exes and your ears for the time and people with whom you live.
This is your first duty; here, you are indispensable, here, God cannot do without you. … Often, we are tempted to complain about people and the time in which we live, but Mary is seeing what is good, although small, although not good enough.
She sees it and she is grateful.

The lintel above the niche contains two registers, the upper one shows the winged sun-disk with the inscriptions "[The] Behedeti" at both sides, the lower one contains a line of text which is for the most part destroyed.
The inscription has been deliberately destroyed during the reign of Thutmosis III and later under Akhenaton.
Most likely it contained the name of Hatshepsut and a title of her, however, only the words "... beloved [fem.] of Amun [destroyed], King of Gods, may she live for ever" have survived.

About 350 transponders are currently in use with most issued to tenants.
A deposit or a flat programming fee is charged for transponders, depending on their actual use.
Not everyone was happy with the system initially. “Many of our tenants are still very young and are not yet fully aware of the need for security.
Partially as a result of past incidents involving theft and other misdemeanours, they now know that the transponders are a good investment and that they benefit greatly from the SimonsVoss system’s flexibility.
“It’s a learning process,” opines Wolf-Bauwens.
System misuse is no longer a problem as a readout of individual access events can be generated.
The Spannwerk‘s current 40 permanent employees are also very happy with the system.
They are able to move about the complex freely using a transponder and each person has access to their respective office or other place of work.
These tiny digital transmitters are also available for use by freelance professionals, cleaners, security staff and trades people.
A transponder battery lasts a long time – up to a million operations or ten years on stand-by. “This is perfect for us, as some of our doors are opened more than a hundred times a day.
That is a lot, but the batteries are very powerful!”

- The position of the Pope concerning Islam is unequivocally that expressed by the conciliar document Nostra Aetate: "The Church regards with esteem also the Muslims. They adore the one God, living and subsisting in Himself; merciful and all-powerful, the Creator of heaven and earth, Who has spoken to men; they take pains to submit wholeheartedly to even His inscrutable decrees, just as Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes pleasure in linking itself, submitted to God.
Though they do not acknowledge Jesus as God, they revere Him as a prophet. They also honor Mary, His virgin Mother; at times they even call on her with devotion.
In addition, they await the day of judgment when God will render their deserts to all those who have been raised up from the dead.
Finally, they value the moral life and worship God especially through prayer, almsgiving and fasting" (no.

Establishment of an organ ex-vivo slice model for cardiovascular research in particular for therapeutic atherosclerosis targeting (111/08) Prof. Patrick Hunziker and Dr. Rahel Bänziger Keel, University Hospital, Basle.
Many laboratory animals are required for research into atherosclerosis (causes of the disease, possible treatments, nanomedicine).
Prof. Hunziker’s research team at the University Hospital in Basle isolate arteries from mice (that lack the ApoE gene) and human material. The arteries are then further examined in a culture medium.
In this way, it is possible not only to reduce the number of laboratory animals required but also to identify any differences in the pattern of development of the disease in mice and humans.

The park is a popular hiking destination but so large that solitude is guaranteed in more remote parts.
Undergrowth is sparse and off-trail hiking generally very easy; there are also plenty of hiking routes.
Not all the forests of the park area are old-growth: there were large-scale fellings up to the 1970s, prior to the establishment of the park 6.
The park area is also used for the grazing of large herds of reindeer, which has a marked negative impact on the lichen cover of the drier forests.
Free camping is allowed in more remote areas. There are also free wilderness huts.
In July, mosquitoes can be very annoying.

When we took over the Lodge in the summer of 1993 we wanted not only to renovate and extend the existing buildings but, at the same time, set out a realistic and environmentally friendly development plan.
Of course the Lodge needed to be modernised but at the same time we wanted to try and preserve the charm of an old log cabin hotel.
Consequently, we were willing to accept some of the disadvantages of the wooden structures - for example, poor sound insulation - in order not to become an average mediocre Hotel.
The old building structure was maintained, with rooms of approximately 12 to 25 square meters in size which, by todays standards, are rather small, stairs and floors that creak and limitations in the kitchen area, etc. It was never our intention to offer luxury, but rather a place to relax, to experience and enjoy.

Yet, even if caught red-handed by the units of the naval forces deployed against piracy - state - 80% of the pirates is released and put in a position to carry out new attacks.This happens - say BIMCO, ICS, Intercargo, Intertanko and ITF - because the politicians in the world do not realize the seriousness of this situation, whereas it is the governments who can decide who and how to resolve this crisis.
However - stress - the governments seem unwilling to face reality and act, and their instructions given to naval forces fielded against piracy are simply to implement measures of deterrence and enforcement, unless interests are affected national.

However, landscape painting also offered history painters like Philips Koninck and Rubens an opportunity to dispense with moral izing content. Philips Koninck developed an unconventional form of panoramic landscape (see right).
In contrast to the Flemish landscape tradition, here the sky takes over more than half the height of the picture. Koninck boldly dispenses with any accent that might fix the image, whether in the center or at the edge of the picture.
Only the reflection of the clouds in the river which runs through the scene provides any kind of focus. In spite of the path in the foreground which runs at an angle, the field of vision is no longer closed by a diagonal composition, but is built up from hori zontals parallel to the picture plane, graduated in strips in the back ground.

Born in Basel, but professionally active for most of his life in Frankfurt am Main, the engraver Matthäus Merian the Elder (1593–1650) is mainly known for his superb graphic prints.
For instance, his Topographia Germaniae (Topography of Germany), which contained more than 2000 individual prints and texts on German cities in sixteen volumes, is considered the first guidebook.
These “Descriptions and Actual Replicas,” Merian’s illustrations of the Lutheran Bible, and his Theatrum Europaeum (European Theater) on the Thirty Years’ War secured him a place over the generations of art history, but the great significance of his drawings has only recently been recognized by experts.
Lucas Heinrich Wüthrich, the author of, among other things, the standard biography of Merian and without a doubt the most prominent contemporary expert on the Baroque-era genius published the first edition of these valuable discoveries in 1963.
Now, in this new publication, the art scholar elucidates in his customarily profound manner the catalogue of these charming little works of art, which has grown considerably, thanks to the many new attributions that have been verified since then.

- "The question is how to speak of sin with regard to the justified without limiting the reality of salvation.
While Lutherans express this tension with the term 'controlled sin' (peccatum regnatum) which expresses the teaching of the Christian as 'being justified and sinner at the same time' (simul iustus et peccator), Roman Catholics think the reality of salvation can only be maintained by denying the sinful character of concupiscence.
With regard to this question a considerable rapprochement is reached if LV:E calls the concupiscence that remains in the justified a 'contradiction to God' and thus qualifies it as sin" (VELKD 82,29-39).

From these presuppositions—today widely diffused—it seems clear that this new formulation of the principle of “Scripture alone” has not guaranteed a sense of the objectivity of Scripture, even though it speaks explicitly of the Institution in the four accounts handed down, that the Lord in fact, on the night in which he was betrayed, handed over to his very own body and blood, in the form of bread and wine, and that in these gifts he established the new covenant.
The hypotheses of the origin of the texts parallel the biblical word as such.
Conversely, it appears evident that Tradition, as defined by the Church, does not imply the manipulation of Scripture through teachings and other uses, but on the contrary it represents a guarantee because the word of Scripture can maintain its significance.

Lawrence Weiner's art uses language in reference to materials.
Language itself is a material and at the same time a means of presentation of his work. Weiner evolved this approach in the context of the Conceptual Art of the late sixties.
Yet he does not see his own work as "conceptual."
The "space" he works within is the entire cultural context.
His works are associated with various different media and forms of presentation: books, posters, videos, films, records, drawings, multiples, installations indoors and outdoors, and more.
Since his earliest days as a professional artist Weiner has given written and verbal expression to questions concerning his work and its context.
The utterances (statements, interviews, lectures, conference contributions) have been collected together in this publication for the first time, and ordered chronologically.
Taken as a whole they afford an insight both into a complex individual biography and into the wider development of art and culture and the challenge that this entails.

The team did what they could to reach out to Paul, despite his constant rejections. But God was working in Paul’s life in ways that no person could ever have attempted to accomplish on his own.
We can only imagine the thoughts that went through Paul’s head and the brokenness he experienced in his heart that led him to the team’s next interaction with him on Christmas 2008. It was then that Paul approached Nawal, feeling uncomfortable about talking to “the man that he had rejected for so many years.”
But Nawal knew what Paul most needed to hear. “He loves you, you know,” she told him.
And so Paul did, asking Anis a very blunt and honest question. “Will you be there for me when I get out?”
The question was full of a dying hope that had found new life.
Paul needed love, and when he finally decided to reach out, he found love was reaching back.
It always had been, through the pursuit of Christ, visibly extended through the love of the House of Light team.
It was then that Paul opened himself to such love, and committed his life to Christ in December 2008.

Soaps are handmade, by cold processing allowing them to conserve their natural resources.
Then I let the soaps ripe for at least 6 weeks in a controlled atmosphere, where the process of saponification, during which the natural glycerine is produced, takes place.The soap therefore does not have only the basic function of cleaning, moistening and protecting. It is suitable for all skin types, even for children and the face.

The rate of accumulation at any moment determines both the growth of labor power and its displacement by the extension of production and the increase of exploitation.
The increase of exploitation, however, is the prerequisite for the extension of production; and so long as the latter does not come up against objective limits, the former has an unobstructed path.
These objective limits are set by labor-time relations, specifically by the relation between value and surplus value, between wages and profits.
If the surplus value produced by a given quantity of labor power cannot be increased, it becomes impossible to exploit additional labor power, since this would require additional means of production, made available by accumulation.

The perspective correction depends on the focal length.
Therefore also this parameter can be entered in to the program, whereby the focal length is to be indicated here in millimeters according to the 35mm equivalent.
Focal length dependence shows up in the result by interfering with the picture perpendicularly to the shift direction.
With JPEG pictures of certain cameras the program tries to determine the focal length from the EXIF data.
If that is not possible and the focal length used with the photographs is not readily determined, it can be estimated.
Usually one is correcting convergence distortion caused by the use of wide-angle lenses, so the program takes a "safe" standard assuming a 28mm wide-angle lens was used.

But there is a particular reason why the freedom to modify is crucial for documentation for free software.
When people exercise their right to modify the software, and add or change its features, if they are conscientious they will change the manual too--so they can provide accurate and usable documentation with the modified program.
A manual which forbids programmers to be conscientious and finish the job, or more precisely requires them to write a new manual from scratch if they change the program, does not fill our community's needs.

KURDWATCH, February26,2014—On February18,2014, employees of the Asayiş, the security service of the Democratic Union Party(PYD), occupied the rooms of the private radio station ARTAFM in ʿAmudah.
They demanded that the majority of the employees leave their workplaces, and the offices were subsequently searched.
The regular broadcast was taken off air, and only music could be broadcast.
On February20, the regular programming could be resumed.
The Asayiş justified the measures against ARTAFM by claiming that an additional unauthorized radio station, RadioMICT, was broadcasting from the rooms.
Although the administration of ARTAFM presented the PYD with a corresponding authorization, the broadcasting of RadioMICT was cut off.
Prior to the closure, employees of ARTAFM had accused the director of the station, Sirwan Hajj Husayn, of corruption and self-enrichment.
Hajj Husayn denied the accusations.

This direct and immediate dependence of national self-determination of weak peoples upon the collective European regime excludes the possibility of the proletariat’s placing questions like the independence of Poland or the uniting of all Serbs outside the European revolution.
But, on the other hand, this signifies that the right of self-determination, as a part of the proletarian peace program, possesses not a “utopian” but a revolutionary character.
This consideration is directed to two addresses: against the German Davids and Landsbergs who from the heights of their imperialist “realism” traduce the principle of national independence as reactionary romanticism; and against the simplifiers in our revolutionary camp who proclaim this principle to be realizable only under socialism and who thereby rid themselves of the necessity of giving a principled answer to the national questions which have been posed point-blank by the war.

When my father died, having left the flavour of atheism in us, we came at first to his mother, my grandmother, who was the very opposite of him.
The church was the alpha and omega of her life philosophy.
That may not have necessarily meant anything to me had I not have to confront in my mind the murdering "priest" with the necessity of belief in God, which was, moreover, recommended to the child by someone who wanted the God to feed the child, while she herself did not have to.
That was very difficult to cope with and it also resulted in the first mental conflict in my life.

Certainly, the internationalisation of capital has forced competing capitals to merge into ever bigger units – but until recently, this has not necessarily meant trans-European units.
In fact, in the 1960s and 1970s the tendency was for the concentration of capital to take place within national state structures, with the assistance of national states.
Between 1961 and 1969 there were 1,896 significant mergers between firms within individual countries, as against only 257 between firms in different European Community countries.

Wherever newspapers were printed digitally on any perceptible scale in the past, this was usually in the form of so-called “island editions”.
For such cases, inkjet systems generally emerged as the printing technology of choice, thanks to the significantly higher productivity compared to toner-based systems and the relatively low costs for short runs using a process which eliminates printing plates and the associated makeready costs.
Until recently, however, the major suppliers of these systems had their roots exclusively in the IT sector (main focus: business forms).
The systems were engineered accordingly, with all the attendant application limitations.
It can scarcely be unexpected, therefore, that doubt was sown regarding the professional suitability and reliability for newspaper production, and that potential investors were unwilling to commit the required sums.

Nicosia (Agenzia Fides) – To maintain an atmosphere of peace in the financial crisis: is what the Christian leaders of the island of Cyprus, part of the World Council of Churches ask, who expressed "support for dialogue and peace in the island", crossed by the severe financial crisis affecting the population.
Recalling that the churches are "always committed to promoting dialogue and religious freedom" – explains a note sent to Fides Agency - leaders underline that, especially at a difficult time for the people, one must still remain loyal to values such as "inter-religious dialogue , respect for human rights, peace and reconciliation," which bore fruit in the historic building of peace on the island.
The Christian leaders, led by Archbishop Chrysostomos II of Cyprus, reaffirm their commitment to meet the mufti of Cyprus, Islamic leader, to share speeches on topics such as peace, human rights and religious freedom. In this way, religions can offer their particular "contribution of values" for the solution of the present economic crisis: "It is our firm belief that religious leaders have a responsibility and a unique role to play in the peace process" and in helping the nation to address the economic, social and political challenges.

Cambridge is basically a very nice city with impressive university buildings. Nevertheless, I felt as I would be bored there after some time.
The city makes a really old impression and not really like one of a young student city.
Anyway, I enjoyed the day there a lot. Thanks to Nick I knew a little where to go, although we missed unfortunately all the restaurants he recommended to me.
We've found them all, Nick ? but not by the time we were hungry ;).
Never mind ? thanks a lot for the advice!!!
Some pictures of Cambridge are available here:

After San Pedro we went back through Calama and Chuquicamata were we visited the biggest open pit copper mine in the world.
The mine is 875 m deep. Chile's reserves and production amount to 18 % of the world's copper.
Copper was nationalized under Salvador Allende from American companies.
Today the government receives the earnings which then benefit all Chilean citizens.
